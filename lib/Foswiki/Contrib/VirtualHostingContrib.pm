# $Rev: 3193 $ so that Foswiki can determine the checked-in status of the
# extension.

# $RELEASE is used in the "Find More Extensions" automation in configure.
# It is a manually maintained string used to identify functionality steps.
# You can use any of the following formats:
# tuple   - a sequence of integers separated by . e.g. 1.2.3. The numbers
#           usually refer to major.minor.patch release or similar. You can
#           use as many numbers as you like e.g. '1' or '1.2.3.4.5'.
# isodate - a date in ISO8601 format e.g. 2009-08-07
# date    - a date in 1 Jun 2009 format. Three letter English month names only.
# Note: it's important that this string is exactly the same in the extension
# topic - if you use %$RELEASE% with BuildContrib this is done automatically.

        We are sorry, but we could not find what you were looking for. There is
        no configuration for <code>$hostname</code> in our servers.

      <p>
        It's possible that the <code>$hostname</code> site is under
        construction, and will be publicly available on some time.

      <p>
        If you got here by following a link in another website, it would be
        nice if you notify its administrators that the link did not lead to a
        valid website.
