%TOC%

---++ Overview

!VirtualHostingContrib provides the ability of using a single Foswiki
installation to serve differents sets of webs under different host names. Such
different hostnames by which users access different content are known as
_virtual hosts_.

For users, it will look like they have an exclusive Foswiki installation. The
system administrator, however, needs to maintain and upgrade a single Foswiki
installation. This solution allows for instance service providers to offer
Foswiki systems without having a linear increase in maintainance effort.

---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

---++ Configuration

!VirtualHostingContrib works by providing an alternative entry point to the
classic Foswiki scripts interface. To use it, you need to configure your
webserver so that requests to e.g. =/foswiki/bin/view= are actually handled by
the =/foswiki/bin/virtualhosts= CGI script. Such script will play the role of
all the other scripts, but before serving each request it will setup the
appropriate environment for the virtual host being used.

---+++ Lighttpd

---+++ Apache

TODO

---+++ Using <nop>FastCGI

The =virtualhosts= script is a regular CGI script, and as such it may exhibit
poor performance in sites with low computing power or high usage, just like
regular Foswiki. !VirtualHostingContrib provides a !FastCGI version of the
script.

To use it:

   1 Make sure you have [[Foswiki:Extensions/FastCGIEngineContrib][FastCGIEngineContrib]] installed and properly working on your system.
   1 In your web server configuration for the virtual sites, replace the references to the
     =foswiki.fcgi= script provided by !FastCGIEngineContrib with =virtualhosts.fcgi= provided by !VirtualHostingContrib.
      * You will still need a conventional configuration for the _base_ site for access to conigure.
   1 Reload your web server configuration to apply the changes.

---++ Virtual hosts management

This section describes how to perform common maintenance activities on your
virtual hosts.

---+++ Settings

The following settings are available for this contrib in the Foswiki
configuration interface:

| *Setting* | *Meaning* | *Default value* |
| =VirtualHostsDir= | The directory in which you virtual hosts are stored | (empty) uses =/path/to/foswiki/virtualhosts= |
| =ServerAlias= | a mapping of aliases to real hostnames | |
| =DisabledServers= | a list of servers that are disabled temporarily even though there's a valid environment present in =VirtualHostsDir= | |

---+++ The structure of a virtualhost

Each virtual host consists of a subdirectory of
=$Foswiki::cfg{VirtualHostingContrib}{VirtualHostsDir}=, named after the
hostname it is intended to serve. Take the following example:

<verbatim>
  virtualhosts/
    example.com/
      ...
    mydomain.net/
      ...
</verbatim>

In this case, there are two virtual hosts, one for the =example.com= domain and
other for the =mydomain.net= domain.

Inside each virtual host directory, there are some directories that resemble
the ones in the main Foswiki installation:

| *Directory* | *Stores* |
| =data/= | topic data |
| =pub/= | attachments and other files that must be directly accessible by clients |
| =templates/= | custom templates for this virtual host only |
| =working/= | all sorts of temporary data |

#HostSettings
---+++ Virtual host specific settings

In each virtual host root, the server administrator can put a file called
=VirtualHost.cfg=, which may contain Foswiki configuration variables. This way
you can have different settings for different virtual hosts. For example, you
can have some virtual hosts using the standard .htpasswd Foswiki user
management, and others using !LDAP to authenticate users.

To create your local configuration, just create a file called =VirtualHost.cfg=
inside the virtual host directory. Inside the file, you use the =$VirtualHost=
hash the same way you would use =$Foswiki::cfg= in the global Foswiki
configuration.

Example:

<verbatim>
# disable FooPlugin in this virtual host
$VirtualHost{Plugins}{FooPlugin}{Enabled} = 0;

# use LDAP contrib in this virtual host
$VirtualHost{PasswordManager} = 'Foswiki::Users::LdapPasswdUser';
$VirtualHost{UserMappingManager} = 'Foswiki::Users::LdapUserMapping';
# ...
</verbatim>

Note that <strong>all occurrances of =$Foswiki::cfg= in the virtual host
configuration will be replaced by =$VirtualHost=.</strong> This way you can
still copy and paste configuration examples into your virtual host
configuration, but the virtual host configuration won't affect the global
configuration. A side effect of this is that you cannot do smart things such
as:

<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{AuthScripts} .= ',view';
</verbatim>

%RED% *Warning:* %ENDCOLOR% just like Foswiki's global configuration file
=LocalSite.cfg=, virtual host configuration files are executed as Perl code.
So the system administrator must be completely sure of what to put in that
configuration file.

---+++ Creating/disabling/removing/renaming virtual hosts

*To create a virtual host*, a configuration wizard is now available under the
Extensions -> VirtualHostingContrib -> ={VirtualHostingContrib}{VirtualHostsDir}= key.

Click the button, and enter the name of the desired hostname into the next
dialog, and select the desired options. (Don't enter the hostname into the directory field.)  Other fields in
the dialog include:

==Host template name==

If you have one or more special virtual hosts named with a leading underscore (ie.  =_template=),
you can choose it in a drop-down box in the dialog.  It will be copied
over to the new virtual host.

If there is no =_template= virtual host or you chose the =-none-= option, the
script will create the virtual host by copying files from the main Foswiki
data; this is suggested if your installation contains only virtual hosts, so
the main Foswiki data will always be clean. If the host supports symbolic
links, the %SYSTEMWEB%, and the =_empty= and =_default= template webs will be linked
rather than copied.

You can also create a =_template=
virtual host manually by copying the files from a Foswiki release tarball,
or by manually creating the data you want for every newly created virtual hosts.

If your installation is brand new and you plan to use the main Foswiki data
afterwards, you can also create the =_template= virtual host using the script,
and that will _freeze_ a copy of the main Foswiki data for new virtual hosts
created later. (*caution* If you are running from a git checkout using
pseudoinstall, any symbolic links in the webs will be preserved in the copy.)

==Config template name==

If you have a text file(s) named with a leading underscore (ie.  =_template.conf=)
in your virtual hosts directory, you can chose the template config name in the
dialog.

When you create a virtual host for example.com you'll also get a
=example.com.conf= file which is copied from the selected =_template.conf= file,
All occurrences of =%<nop>VIRTUALHOST%= will be replaced by the
virtual host name (=example.com= in this example). __Note__ that
!VirtualHostingContrib does not care about the contents of the file, it just
takes the content of =_template.conf=, replaces all occurrences of
%VIRTUALHOST% by the virtual host name.

*Caution:* The config file must be an executable perl file following the rules
of the !LocalSite.cfg, and as described above in [[#HostSettings]].

==Create .htpasswd file==

By default, a new =.htpasswd= file will be created in the virtual hosts's data
directory.  If you un-check the checkbox and bypass creation of .htpasswd,
registration will be disabled in the new virtual host.

<div class="foswikiHelp">%T% Note that the configuration wizard will honor the
configured web names in the master configuration, only when creating a new
virtual host from scratch:
   * =$Foswiki::cfg{SystemWebName}=
   * =$Foswiki::cfg{UsersWebName}=
   * =$Foswiki::cfg{SandboxWebName}=
   * =$Foswiki::cfg{TrashWebName}=
If a template host is used, then whatever web names that exist in the
template's data and pub directories will be used.  If they are different from
the master site's configured names, then a custom =virtualhost.conf= *must* be
used.
</div>

---++++ Running the wizard with =tools/configure=

The =CreateVHost= wizard can be run from the CLI as well.   The arguments are:

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *default* | *Example* |
| =name= | virtual hostname to create | (required) | =-args name=foo.mysite.com= |
| =createpasswd= | Create the =.htpasswd= file. | no password file created | =-args createpasswd=1= |
| =template= | Template host to copy | host will be copied from master webs | =-args template=_templateweb= |
| =templatecfg= | Template file to copy into configuration | no config created | =-args templatecfg=_template.conf= |

*Caution:* Always run this wizard using the web server's userid
<verbatim>
sudo -u www-data tools/configure -wizard CreateVHost -method create_vhost_2 -args name=foo.site.com -args createpasswd=1
sudo -u www-data tools/configure -wizard CreateVHost -method create_vhost_2 -args name=foo2.site.com -args template=_template templatecfg=_template.conf
</verbatim>


---++++ Managing virtual hosts

*To disable a virtual host*, add it to the list of =DisabledServers=. This
is a comma-separated list of those hosts that are temporarily inactive and won't
be served anymore until you either remove it from the =DisabledServers=
list again or remove the files of the virtual host permanently.

*To remove a virtual host*, just remove the its files.  If you are removing the
virtual host for =example.com=, and your virtual hosts are stored in
/var/lib/foswiki/virtualhosts (see [[#Settings]]), then it is enough to remove
the =/var/lib/foswiki/virtualhosts/example.com= directory, plus any webserver
configuration you have for that virtual host.

*To rename a virtual host*, you just have to rename it's directory, and if it's
the case, change the configuration files accordingly.  Beware that after
renaming a virtual host its data will _no longer_ be available at the old
domain name.

*To create an alias name for a virtual host*, add a name mapping to the 
=ServeraAlias= hash of your global configuration in =LocalSite.cfg=. For
instance use the following to access the =example.com= domain using the
a different network interface as well:

<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{VirtualHostingContrib}{ServerAlias} = {
  '127.0.0.1' => 'example.com',
</verbatim>

Note that you also need to configure your http server to listen to
the alias name to make use of this feature.

%RED% *Warning:* %ENDCOLOR% in most cases where both domains, the canonical domain 
and the alias one, are reachable on the same network interface it is preferable
to use a http redirect from one domain to the other instead of creating another
domain that basically serves the same content. Also, SSL certificates appear to
be invalid when served from the wrong domain. Don't use server aliases for in
that case. 

Using a server alias does make sense when the same domain isn't
reachable on a second network interface from where you'll only be able to
reach the server using the alias name. This might also be the case when
maintaining the site on a different server offline and syncing content later on
to the machine that is able to serve the canonical domain.

---++++ Using the original shell script to create a Virtual Host
You can use the provided script at
=tools/virtualhosts-create.sh=. To create a virtual host for the example.com
domain, you should run it like that:

<verbatim>
$ ./tools/virtualhosts-create.sh example.com
</verbatim>

If you run this script as a user different from the one that runs the Foswiki
code (e.g. you create the virtualhost as =root= but your web server runs as
=www-data= or =nobody=), the =data/= and =pub/= directories will be their
ownership properly set to the correct user (i.e. =www-data= or =nobody=).

---+++ Running command line tools against the virtual hosts

!VirtualHostingContrib comes with a set of tools to run specific tasks on the
commandline, such as

   * virtualhosts-mailnotify: a vhost-aware replacement for the standard mailnotify
     script used in cronjobs to send out mail notifications
   * virtualhost-statistics: a vhost-aware replacement for the standard statistics
     script used in cronjobs to update the WebStatistics files in each web
   * virtualhosts-rest: call a rest handler for a specific virtual host on the commandline
   * virtualhosts-tick-foswiki: a vhost-aware replacement for the standard tick-foswiki
     maintenance script used in cronjobs
   * virtualhosts-view: render a page of a virtual host on the commandline
   * virtualhosts-jsonrpc: a vhost-aware commandline tool for the JSON-RPC interface of 
     [[Foswiki:Extensions/JsonRpcContrib][JsonRpcContrib]]
   * virtualhosts-convert-charset:  Run the CharsetConverterContrib convert
     utility against virtual hosts when migrating From Foswiki 1.x to Foswiki
     2.x.
   * virtualhosts-convertTopicSettings: Utility for converting from Foswiki
     1.x style deprecated DENY rules to Foswiki 2.x * Wildcard ACLs

These scripts are located in the =tools/= subdirectory of your Foswiki installation
and can be called from the commandline. They all understand the usual parameters
that their non-vhost-aware counterparts have. In addition, they all take an
optional =host= parameter that lets you specify on which virtual host to run
the command. When no host parameter is specified, the command will be run on
all known virtual hosts known.

For example, to run a REST handler =check= implemented by a !MyNewPlugin extension, use

<verbatim>
cd tools
./virtualhosts-rest host=example.com /MyNewPlugin/check topic=Main.WebHome option=foo
</verbatim>

(TODO: virtualhosts-mailnotify doe not yet understand =host=).

---++ How it works

This section describes the internals of !VirtualHostingContrib, and is intended
for developers and system administrators. If it's not your case, please feel
free to skip it.

---+++ Tweaking the global configuration

In order to serve different sets of webs within the same Foswiki installation,
we need to tweak the Foswiki configuration to change some settings, such as
=DataDir= and =PubDir= (the directories where topic text and attachments are
stored, respectively).

The Foswiki configuration is loaded during compilation time, but when using
persistent execution models (e.g. !ModPerl, !FastCGI), the Foswiki Perl code is
compiled only once for multiple requests.  This wat, the needed configuration
tweaking must be done once for each request, and moreover must not not leave
any trail for the next request, which will possibly be handlind a different
virtual host (and thus different settings for =DataDir=, =PubDir=, etc.).

We need something like this:

<verbatim>
               +-----------------+
               |                 |
    +----------+ Foswiki startup +
    |          |                 |
    |          +-----------------+
    | Main
    | configuration
    | loaded
    |
    |           Configuration cleaned
    |    +---------------------------------+
    |    |                                 |
    |    V                                 |
+------------------+             +---------+---------+
| Incoming Request +             | Outgoing Response +
+--------+---------+             +-------------------+
         |                                 ^
         | Configuration ajusted           |
         | for current virtual host        |
         |                                 |
         |                                 |
         |     +--------------------+      |
         |     |                    |      |
         +---->| Request processing +------+
               | (conf. loaded)     |
               +--------------------+
</verbatim>

Since all Foswiki-specific processing happens inside the "Request processing"
box, then if we manage to tweak the configuration before it is run and to
restore it after the request is processed, we are all set. For that, we hook in
the Foswiki engines system.

---+++ The Foswiki engines system

All requests are processes by the current Foswiki engine in the following way
(=$self= is the engine object):

| 1 | A Request object is prepared, | <code>$req = $self->prepare()</code> |
| 2 | The processing is delegated to the =Foswiki::UI= module. This module detects what was the called script (view, edit, attach etc.), instantiates a =Foswiki= session and does all of the actual processing to produce a result for the client. In special, this phase is the only one in which the vast majority of the Foswiki configuration matters. | <code>$res = Foswiki::UI::handleRequest($req)</code> |
| 3 | The engine does a cleanup and sends the response back to the client | $self->finalize($req, $req) |

So, our objective is to wrap *step 2* as the figure above shows: we adjust the
configuration for the current request just before entering
=Foswiki::UI::handleRequest=, and restore the configuration just after it
finishes.

---+++ The Perl =local()= construct

The Perl =local()= construct enables the programmer to set a global variable
until the end of the current block. After the current block exits, the value is
restored to its original value. This can be also used with hash elements: in
this case, only the elements changed with =local= are restored when the scope
ends.

Example:
<verbatim>
use Foswiki;
# Assume that DataDir is set initially to "/path/to/foswiki/data"
print $Foswiki::cfg{DataDir}, "\n"
{
   local = $Foswiki::cfg{DataDir} = "/path/to/virtualhosts/example.com/data";
   print $Foswiki::cfg{DataDir}, "\n";
}
print $Foswiki::cfg{DataDir}, "\n"
</verbatim>

The above example will print the following:

<verbatim>
/path/to/foswiki/data
/path/to/virtualhosts/example.com/data
/path/to/foswiki/data
</verbatim>

This way we can override the settings we need, and also gain the cleanup step
for free since Perl will automatically revert all changes done with local when
the block ends.

For more information on =local()=, please refer to "Temporary Values via
local()" in the perlsub(1) manpage (you must have Perl's documentation
installed in your system).

---+++ Wrapping it up

What !VirtualHostingContrib does is to wrap the Foswiki::UI::handleRequest so
that the configuration is tweaked just before actually handling the request,
using the approach described above. The two extra CGI scripts provided are
equal to the ones in Foswiki core and !FastCGIEngineContrib, but after loading
Foswiki::UI, they load the !VirtualHostingContrib module that does the wrapping
around Foswiki::UI::handleRequest.

---++ Info for developers

This section presents tips for developing of virtualhost-friendly code:

---+++ reading Foswiki configuration values

When you need to read Foswiki configuration options, make sure you do not do it
during compile Time. Since virtualhost requests temporarily redefine part of
the configuration, if you freeze a configuration value during a request for
virtualhost A, you'll probably have problems when using that value in a request
for virtualhost B.

Example: if you do something like this:

<verbatim>
use vars qw($RE);
BEGIN {
  $RE = qr/$Foswiki::cfg{SomeOption}/;
}
</verbatim>

If this code runs under !ModPerl, !FastCGI or other persistent engine, Then the
<code>$RE</code> variable will be initialized in the first time that code is
loaded, and that may be in the context of a specific virtual host. In a future
request, $RE will still contain a value derived from the value of
<code>$Foswiki::cfg{SomeOption}</code> for the original virtualhost, even if
the current virtualhost redefines <code>$Foswiki::cfg{SomeOption}</code>.

To fix this, you should avoid initializing values that depend on the
configuration during compile-time. Instead, compose the values you need during
runtime:

<verbatim>
sub do_stuff {
  my $RE = qr/$Foswiki::cfg{SomeOption}/;
  // use $RE here ...
}
</verbatim>

or in a OO context:

<verbatim>
sub new {
  // ...
  $this->{RE} = qr/$Foswiki::cfg{SomeOption}/;
  // ...
}

sub method {
  my $this = shift;
  // use $this->{RE} ...
}
</verbatim>

---+++ Avoid using the 'o' regular expression flag together with configuration values

If you need a regular expression that is composed from values in the
configuration, make sure you don't use the 'o' flag, which causes the regular
expression to be compiled only once. For example, in the following code the
<code>$Foswiki::cfg{SomeOption}</code> will be expanded only in the first time
the expression is evaluated:

<verbatim>
my $RE = qr/$Foswiki::cfg{SomeOption}/o;
</verbatim>

Even is a virtualhost redefined <code>$Foswiki::cfg{SomeOption}</code>, the
value used in that regular expression will be the value defined in the context
of the virtualhost that was being processed during the first time that
expression was evaluated.

So, avoid the 'o' flag when interpolating configuration values in regular
expressions. The following real code shows the problem:

<verbatim>
use vars qw($GLOBAL);

$GLOBAL = 'Main';

sub f {
  my $re = qr/(?:$GLOBAL\.)/o;
  print $re, "\n";
}

f();
$GLOBAL = 'Users';
f();
</verbatim>

The two calls to f() will print the same value, based on the value
<code>$GLOBAL</code> has in the first time the regular expression was
evaluated:

<verbatim>
$ perl test.pl
(?-xism:(?:Main\.))
(?-xism:(?:Main\.))
</verbatim>

If you remove the 'o' flag from the regular expresion, you will obtain the
desired result:

<verbatim>
$ perl test.pl
(?-xism:(?:Main\.))
(?-xism:(?:Users\.))
</verbatim>
